The lobby is a small room. The exit is to the south. There are doorways east to a lounge, west to a bar, and north to a hallway. A staircase leads up to the second floor.

HOTEL_BAR
There is a long bar along the west wall. Since the bar is closed, there is no bartender at the moment. There is a closed door in the north wall. Another doorway leads east to the lobby.

This is a pleasant room with a couch and two armchairs. An old fellow is sleeping in one of the chairs, an old newspaper lays folded in his lap. A doorway leads west to the lobby.

HOTEL_HALL_TOP
At the top of the stairs, you find your way blocked. A locked door is in the north wall and a hallway stretches east and west. However, stacked furniture blocks your way east and a large box blocks your way west. You can take the stairs back down to the lobby.

#
HOTEL_BAR_RR
You are in a tiny bathroom. The sink is broken and the toilet hasn't seen a plumber in more than a decade. The stench is...less than pleasant. You should return south to the bar.
#
HOTEL_CLOSET_TOP
You have discovered a supply closet! It's full of junk. Congratulations on your amazing discovery.
#
HOTEL_HALL_WEST
This creepy hallway extends west into darkness. The carpet is dusty and littered with various broken and torn items of no interest to you. Cobwebs hang from a naked bulb dangling from the ceiling. There are doors leading to hotel rooms to the north and south. You can return east to the stairway.
