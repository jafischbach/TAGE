HOTEL_LOBBY
The lobby is a small room. The exit is to the south. There are doorways east to a lounge, west to a bar, and north to a hallway. A staircase leads up to the second floor.
#
HOTEL_BAR
There is a long bar along the west wall. Since the bar is closed, there is no bartender at the moment. There is a closed door marked "Rest Room" in the north wall. Another doorway leads east to the lobby.

HOTEL_BAR_B
There is a long bar along the west wall. There is a closed door marked "Rest Room" in the north wall. Another doorway leads east to the lobby. 

A man now stands behind the bar pretending not to notice you. Must be the hotel bartender.
#
HOTEL_BAR_C
This used to be a bar. Now it's nothing more than the bartender's gruesome tomb. There is a closed door, dripping with former bartender, in the north wall. Another doorway leads east to the lobby.
#
HOTEL_LOUNGE
This is a pleasant room with a couch and two armchairs. An old man is sleeping in one of the chairs, an old newspaper lays folded in his lap. A doorway leads west to the lobby.

#
HOTEL_HALL_1ST
You are in a short, dead-end hallway. A door in the west wall is marked "101" and a door in the east wall is marked "Employees Only." You can return south to the lobby.
#
HOTEL_HALL_TOP
At the top of the stairs, you find your way blocked. A locked door is in the north wall and a hallway stretches east and west. However, stacked furniture blocks your way east and a large box blocks your way west. You can take the stairs back down to the lobby.
#
HOTEL_HALL_TOP_B
You are at the top of the stairs. A door is in the north wall and a hallway stretches east and west. However, stacked furniture blocks your way east and a large box blocks your way west. You can take the stairs back down to the lobby.
#
HOTEL_HALL_TOP_C
You are at the top of the stairs. A door is in the north wall and a hallway stretches east and west. Stacked furniture blocks your way east but the way west is now clear. Debris from the demolished box litters the floor. You can take the stairs back down to the lobby.
#
HOTEL_BAR_RR
You are in a tiny bathroom. The sink is broken and the toilet hasn't seen a plumber in more than a decade. The stench is...less than pleasant. You should return south to the bar.
#
HOTEL_CLOSET_TOP
You have discovered a supply closet! It's full of junk. Congratulations on your amazing discovery. Actually, there is a cool chest sitting on the floor.
#
HOTEL_HALL_WEST
This creepy hallway extends west into darkness, but it's too dark to go that way. The carpet is dusty and littered with various broken and torn items of no interest to you. Cobwebs hang from a naked bulb dangling from the ceiling. There are doors leading to hotel rooms to the north and south. The south door is smarked "201" and the north door is marked "202". You can return east to the stairway.
#
HOTEL_ROOM_201
You are standing in a typical hotel bedroom. Well, typical except for the excessive amount of dust. It's clear that no one (other than you) has set foot in this room in years. There is a bed, a nightstand, and a closet. A rug keeps the dust off part of the hardwood floor.
#
HOTEL_ROOM_202
This was probably a hotel room once upon a time. It's mostly empty now. Just you, lots of dust, a refrigerator that's happily humming away, and a hole in the wall. There's also a wolverine. He seems a little miffed that you've disturbed his peace.

HOTEL_ROOM_202_B

#
HOTEL_ROOM_101
What a nice bedroom! There's a neatly made bed, a nightstand, and a closet. A picture of two gentleman hangs on the wall. There's not a speck of dust anywhere!
#
HOTEL_EMPLOYEES_ONLY
You're in a small room with a door to the west and a staircase leading to the basement. There's a broom leaning against the wall, but you're not in the mood for sweeping.
#
HOTEL_BASEMENT
The hotel's basement. What a dank and unpleasant place. It's poorly lit, full of dust (like most of the hotel), and very cold. There are two metal doors. One, in the north wall, is marked "Utlities" and is pretty convincingly locked. Another door, in the south wall, is marked "Exit." If you think that's a way out, you're right. Sadly, it's not YOUR way out. You're never getting through that door, not even with the chainsaw that's sitting on the floor nearby.

HOTEL_UTILITIES
In contrast to the previous room, this one is hot enough to make you sweat. There's a boiler along one wall, a large electric panel on another, and the hotel's laundry machines along a third. A gas can sits on a shelf next to the electric panel. The only exit leads south.

EXIT
Sweet freedom! You finally escape from the worst hotel experience you've ever had. You close your eyes and smell the glorious fresh air. When you open them, you find yourself face to face with an irate officer of the law. The cop blocks your way.
